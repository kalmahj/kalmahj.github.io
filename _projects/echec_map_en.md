## Project Description
This project is a streamlit application that maps all the game bars in Paris, France with the detail of the board games they offer. You can also search for a specific game bar or a specific game, and interact with other users, like a personal social media platform for board game lovers !

Disclaimer : it's not perfect, but it's our attempt of creating our first functional app!

## The people behind this project
- Me, Kalma Hazara, as the head programmer 
- Joseph Csillag
- Laura Fournier
- Kyojin Dumonceau

**Note : The translation into English is not finished, it is purely in French for the time being as it aims France-based users.**
