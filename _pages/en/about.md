I am **José Eduardo Alves Pereira Filho**, a {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 1998 }} years old **Data Scientist** specializing in **Energy** with a strong foundation in electrical engineering.

My academic journey includes a **Double Engineering Degree** from **École Centrale de Nantes** and **UNICAMP** , where I focused on data analysis, signal, and image processing, and was recognized as the best student in electrical engineering with the **CREA-SP 2022 Award**. This was followed by a **Specialized Master's in Optimization of Energy Systems (OSE)** from **MINES PARIS - PSL** , focusing on financial modeling, stochastic optimization, and energy economics.
