Hello curious people ! Welcome to my website !

My name is **Kalma Hazara**, a GIS enthusiast with a knack for mapping and geographic data analysis. I have strong skills in **Python** (geopandas, folium, scikit, pandas), **QGIS** (PyGIS) and the **ESRI ArcGIS platform** (Pro, Online, Experience Builder). 

My academic journey started in Geography, as I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Geography and Urban Planning from **Sorbonne University** in 2024. I then pursued a Professional Master's degree in GIS & Urban & Risk Planning at **CY Cergy Paris Université** to which I also have a work contract as a GIS Analyst in **EDF**. 

I have a strong passion for urban planning, environmental preservation, and urban cleanliness. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge. 

Feel free to browse through my website to learn more about my work and interests.
