I am **Kalma Hazara**, a GIS enthusiast who's currently finishing my **Master's degree in GIS & Urban Planning** at **CY Cergy Paris Université** (2026). I am proficient in **mapping and geospatial** (QGIS, ArcGIS), geodata analysis (Python), and remote sensing (ENVI). 

Currently, I work as a GIS analyst apprentice at **EDF**, applying spatial analysis techniques to french electrification projects. This role has strengthened my technical expertise while deepening my understanding of data-driven urban planning.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Geography and Urban Planning** from **Sorbonne University Paris** (2021), where I developed a multidisciplinary foundation in urban systems and environmental science. 

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in Urban Planning, GIS, Remote Sensing, or Environmental Science. If my profile aligns with your research interests, I welcome the opportunity to connect.**
