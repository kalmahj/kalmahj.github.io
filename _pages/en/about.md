I am **Kalma Hazara**, a geographer and urban planner with roots in Indonesia and the Philippines, now based in Paris, France. My work focuses on the intersection of urban environments, spatial analysis, and community well-being.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Geography and Urban Planning from **Sorbonne University CY Paris** (2021), where I developed a multidisciplinary foundation in urban systems and environmental science. I subsequently will be completing a Master's in GIS & Urban Planning at **CY Cergy Paris Université**, specializing in geospatial technologies, remote sensing, and computational methods.

Currently, I work as a GIS analyst apprentice at **EDF**, applying spatial analysis techniques to real-world infrastructure and environmental projects. This role has strengthened my technical expertise while deepening my understanding of data-driven urban planning.

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in Urban Planning, GIS, Remote Sensing, or Environmental Science. If my profile aligns with your research interests, I welcome the opportunity to connect.**
